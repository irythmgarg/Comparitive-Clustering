# Comparitive-Clustering

Comparative Clustering Analysis with Different Preprocessing Techniques
Overview
Clustering is an essential unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points. The effectiveness of clustering algorithms can vary based on different preprocessing methods, choice of clustering techniques, and the number of clusters (k). This comparative study evaluates Agglomerative Clustering, K-Means, and K-Medoids using multiple preprocessing techniques, such as No Preprocessing, PCA, Normalization, Transformation, Transformation + PCA, and Transformation + PCA + Scaling. The results are assessed using three evaluation metrics:

Silhouette Score (measures cluster separation and cohesion)
Calinski-Harabasz Index (evaluates cluster dispersion)
Davies-Bouldin Index (assesses cluster compactness and separation)
By systematically varying preprocessing methods, clustering algorithms, and cluster counts (k), this analysis helps identify the most effective combination for optimal clustering performance.


Advantages of Comparative Clustering Analysis
Optimized Cluster Quality ---> Different clustering techniques yield varying results based on data distribution. This comparative study helps in selecting the best method based on Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.

Improved Data Preprocessing Selection --->  Preprocessing plays a crucial role in clustering efficiency. By evaluating various methods (e.g., PCA, Normalization, Scaling), we can determine which preprocessing step enhances clustering results the most.

Better Decision-Making for k (Number of Clusters) ---> Using Elbow Plots and Silhouette Scores, we identify the optimal k, ensuring that clusters are well-defined without overfitting or underfitting.

Robustness Across Different Datasets ---> Since real-world datasets vary in size, scale, and noise, this comparative analysis helps in generalizing the best approach across different data distributions.

Reduces Computational Overhead ---> Selecting the best preprocessing + clustering combination reduces unnecessary computations by eliminating ineffective clustering techniques.

Enhanced Model Interpretability ---> Understanding how different algorithms behave under various preprocessing methods helps in interpreting clusters better, which is useful in real-world applications like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and document classification.
